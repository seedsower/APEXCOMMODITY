# 🎉 Critical Issues Fixed - Test Results

## ✅ **All Major Blocking Issues Resolved!**

### **Issues Fixed:**

1. **🔧 WalletProviders Import Errors** - ✅ **FIXED**
   - Removed non-existent `BackpackWalletAdapter` and `SolletWalletAdapter` 
   - Cleaned build cache completely
   - Only using `PhantomWalletAdapter` and `SolflareWalletAdapter`

2. **🌐 Network Configuration** - ✅ **FIXED**  
   - **FORCED DEVNET** connections everywhere
   - WalletProviders: `'https://api.devnet.solana.com'`
   - DriftProvider: Hardcoded devnet configuration
   - TokenVerification: Only checks devnet (no more 403 mainnet errors)

3. **⚙️ Provider Chain** - ✅ **FIXED**
   - DriftProvider properly exported and working
   - WalletProviders SSR-safe with mounted state
   - No more "WalletContext not provided" errors

4. **📦 Build Cache Issues** - ✅ **FIXED**
   - Completely cleaned `.next`, `node_modules`, TypeScript cache
   - Fresh install with force flag
   - Server now starts without errors

## 🚀 **Your App is Now Working!**

### **✅ Current Status:**
- **Homepage**: http://localhost:3000 - ✅ Loading (HTTP 200)
- **Trade Page**: http://localhost:3000/trade - ✅ Loading (HTTP 200)
- **Development Server**: Running on port 3000
- **Critical Errors**: **ALL RESOLVED**

### **🔍 Next Steps for NG Token Balance:**

1. **Open the Trade Page**: http://localhost:3000/trade
2. **Connect Your Wallet** (should work without errors now)
3. **Check "Commodity Token Balances" Panel**:
   - Look for debugging information
   - Click "Refresh Balances" button  
   - Click "Find My NG Token" button
4. **Open Browser Console (F12)** to see detailed debugging logs

### **🐛 Debugging Features Added:**
- **Network Debug Info**: Shows wallet address, current network, NG token config
- **"Refresh Balances" Button**: Fetches balances with detailed console logging
- **"Find My NG Token" Button**: Searches for your NG tokens across networks
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Shows specific reasons if tokens aren't found

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

Your NG token balance should now show up if:
1. You have NG tokens in your connected wallet
2. The tokens are on Devnet (app is now forced to Devnet)
3. The NG token mint address is correctly configured

If you still don't see your NG tokens, the debugging tools will now tell you exactly why (wrong network, no tokens, configuration issue, etc.).
